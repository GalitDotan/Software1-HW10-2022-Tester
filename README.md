# Software1-HW10-2022-Tester
A tester for MyButterReader


## Notes:
This tester tests both files with \r\n and \n.
To check only \n - you can use rocky2.txt.
If you commit those file to your git you have to run those two commends:
1.git config core.autocrlf false
2.git config core.eol crlf
(otherwise git will change every \n to \r\n, and the tester won't work properly)


Good Lock!
